\arguments{
\item{m}{Gams transfer container to read brick results from}

\item{outerObjective}{data frame to write the outer objective to}

\item{p_constructionCalibTarget}{data frame with historic construction flows}

\item{p_renovationCalibTarget}{data frame with historic renovation flows}

\item{tcalib}{numeric, calibration time steps}

\item{varName}{character, column name in \code{outerObjective} to write the result to.
Should be one of 'f', 'fA', 'fMin'.}
